## About

DDD Toolbox is a modern web application that provides strategic design tools for Domain-Driven Design practitioners. Whether you're conducting collaborative workshops, mapping domain boundaries, or documenting complex business processes, our tools help bridge the gap between domain experts and development teams.

## Strategic Design Tools

### ðŸŽ¯ Currently Available

- **[Domain Storytelling](https://dddtoolbox.com/domain-storytelling)** - Visualize and communicate domain knowledge through collaborative storytelling. Create pictorial domain models that bridge the gap between domain experts and development teams.

- **[Event Storming](https://dddtoolbox.com/event-storming)** - Rapidly discover business processes and identify domain boundaries through collaborative workshop techniques. Map out the flow of domain events across your system.

### ðŸ“‹ Planned

- **Context Mapping** - Define and visualize relationships between bounded contexts. Understand integration patterns and team interactions across different parts of your domain.

- **Bounded Context Canvas** - Document and design your bounded contexts using a structured canvas approach. Capture business model, ubiquitous language, and integration patterns.

- **Aggregate Design Canvas** - Design and document your aggregates using a structured canvas approach. Define aggregate boundaries, invariants, and behavioral patterns.

- **Domain Message Flow** - Model the flow of messages and events between different parts of your system. Visualize how information moves across bounded contexts.

## Why this project?

### The Challenge of Modern DDD Workshops

Organizing effective Domain-Driven Design workshops in today's work environment has become increasingly difficult:

- **Remote and hybrid work** makes collaborative modeling sessions harder to coordinate
- **Paper-based workshops** are difficult to review, iterate on, and share with distributed teams
- **Generic whiteboard tools** lack the specific semantics and constraints needed for DDD strategic design

### The Need for Purpose-Built Tools

Although collaboration tools and paid whiteboard templates are available, there's a clear lack of purpose-built solutions for DDD strategic design. We need:

- **Semantically-aware tools** that understand DDD concepts and patterns
- **Guided workflows** that follow established DDD practices and methodologies
- **Iteration-friendly interfaces** that make it easy to refine and evolve domain models
- **Accessible, open-source solutions** that don't require expensive licenses

DDD Toolbox aims to address this lack by providing purpose-built, free tools that understand the nuances of Domain-Driven Design and facilitate effective strategic design sessions.
